Forked from [https://github.com/Optixal/neovim-init.vim](https://github.com/Optixal/neovim-init.vim).

I removed the install shell as it was for debian based systems and I'm on an arch based distro.

I just copied the `init.vim` to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`.

I also needed to point the my locally installed version of python3.
